## Summary



##This project deals with Olympic athletes and their performance in each Olympic event. In this data set we will be comparing the participation of athletes and the metals that they receive for their country in each Olympic year. I got the data set from **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets**. The dataset includes data on the city and year of the Olympic edition, sports, disciplines, participating athletes, National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes, gender of the athletes, specific events, event genders, and the type of medal awarded (Gold, Silver, or Bronze). The data set that we will be using is called Olympics. You can find more about the data set by running in your console view(olympics). The variables for this dataset are - `variable1`: city  `variable2`: Edition( year of olympics) `variable3`: Sport `variable4`:Discipline(swimming, weight lifting, ect)`variable5`: Athlete (name of athlete) `variable6`: NOC (National Olympic Committee codes) `variable7`: Gender (male or female)`variable8` : Event (100 freestyle, discus, ect.)`variable9` : Event_gender ( m or f ). My research questions are as follows. What is the distribution of medals won for each country? What is the distribution of medals won for each country by men compared to women? What country won the most medals in women's events? The methods that I used to answer my questions are as follows. The methods that I used in answering my question would be a bar graph showing the distribution of metals won for each country that is documented in 2000. Then I used another bar graph to show the distribution of the metals won for the United States then split into men and women. Then I did a code chunk to show what country won the most medals in woman's events. My findings are as follows. The distribution for Olympic medals in 2000 is as follows for the top three. The United States was first with 37 gold, 24 silver, and 32 bronze. Russia was second with 32 gold, 28 silver, and 28 bronze. China was third with 28 gold, 16 silver and 14 bronze. In 2012 the women won the most medals for the United States. The women took home 58 medals while the men took home only 45 medals. In 2016 the woman's team that took home the most medals from the events in Rio is the United States.
